The first principle of Epictetus' "The Enchiridion" focuses on understanding what is within our control and what is not, which is a central tenet of Stoic philosophy. This concept is detailed as follows:

### Understanding What is in Our Control

**Distinction Between Control and Lack of Control**: Epictetus opens "The Enchiridion" by stating, "Some things are in our control and others not." He emphasizes that this distinction is crucial for living a fulfilling and serene life.

**Things in Our Control**:

-   **Opinions and Judgments**: Our beliefs, judgments, and the way we evaluate situations are within our control. We can decide how we interpret and respond to events.
-   **Desires and Aversions**: Our desires for certain outcomes and our aversions to others are under our control. We can choose what to want and what to avoid.
-   **Choices and Actions**: The choices we make and our actions are within our control. We are responsible for how we act and respond.

**Things Outside Our Control**:

-   **External Events**: The events that occur in the world, such as natural disasters, actions of others, and global phenomena, are beyond our control.
-   **Other People's Opinions**: What others think of us, their judgments, and their actions are not in our control.
-   **Body and Health**: While we can influence our health to a degree, ultimately, aspects of our body and health are not entirely controllable.
-   **Wealth and Social Status**: Material possessions, wealth, and our position in society are largely influenced by external factors.

**Implications for Living**: Understanding and accepting this distinction is key to peace of mind and happiness in Stoic philosophy. By focusing on what we can control and letting go of what we cannot, we can maintain our tranquility and avoid unnecessary distress.

**Practical Application**:

-   **Responding to Challenges**: When faced with challenges, a Stoic would focus on their own responses and attitudes rather than trying to change the uncontrollable external situation.
-   **Emotional Regulation**: By recognizing that our emotions are within our control, we can work towards responding to situations in a more measured and rational way.

### The Wisdom to Know the Difference

This principle is echoed in the famous Serenity Prayer often used in modern psychological contexts: seeking the serenity to accept what cannot be changed, the courage to change what can be, and the wisdom to know the difference. Epictetus' teachings in this first part of "The Enchiridion" lay the groundwork for understanding and practicing this wisdom in everyday life.
